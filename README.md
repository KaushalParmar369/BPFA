**Overview**

This project includes three main tasks focused on improving business processes. It uses tools like flow diagrams and value stream mapping to make workflows more efficient and easier to understand.



 **Task 1: Coffee Bean Process Flow**
- **Goal**: Show the coffee production steps at Canadian Coffee Bean Roasters (CCBR Ltd).
- **What I Did**:
  - Created a flow diagram showing key steps: hulling, cleaning, grading, roasting, and packaging.
  - Mapped how suppliers, production, and customers are connected.
- **Skills Used**:
  - Drawing process diagrams.
  - Visualizing workflows.


 **Task 2: Simplifying U.S. Health Insurance Claims**
- **Goal**: Make the claims process easier for customers to understand and faster to complete.
- **What I Did**:
  - Identified problems like confusing language and inconsistent steps.
  - Suggested solutions:
    - Simplified forms.
    - Step-by-step educational guides for customers.
  - Proposed changes to cut processing time from 90 to 65-70 days and improve customer satisfaction from 55% to 80%.
- **Skills Used**:
  - Problem-solving.
  - Making processes simpler and clearer.


**Task 3: Value Stream Map for Coffee Bean Production**
- **Goal**: Find bottlenecks and improve the production process.
- **What I Did**:
  - Created a detailed map showing each step in the coffee-making process.
  - Calculated key numbers like:
    - Total production time: 8.87 days.
    - Efficiency score: 0.0012.
  - Found that the hulling step was slowing things down and suggested improvements.
- **Skills Used**:
  - Value stream mapping.
  - Finding and fixing bottlenecks.


**Conclusion**

These tasks helped improve workflows by identifying problems and offering clear solutions. From coffee production to insurance claims, this project focuses on making processes faster, easier, and better.
